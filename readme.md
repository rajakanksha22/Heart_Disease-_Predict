Heart Disease Prediction App
This project provides a simple, interactive web application built with Streamlit to predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on various clinical parameters. The prediction is powered by a pre-trained Machine Learning model.

The primary goal of this application is to offer a user-friendly interface for medical professionals or students to input patient data and instantly receive a prediction on whether the patient has a low or high risk of heart disease.

â–¶How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed on your system.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/rajakanksha22/Heart_Disease-\_Predict.git](https://github.com/rajakanksha22/Heart_Disease-_Predict.git)
cd Heart_Disease-\_Predict

Install Dependencies:
Use the provided requirements.txt file to install all necessary Python libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit App:
Execute the main application file using the Streamlit CLI.

streamlit run app.py

Access the App:
The application will automatically open in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Model Details
The application uses a classification model trained on a heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease Dataset). The model expects input features such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

...and other relevant clinical factors.

The output is a binary prediction (0: Low Risk, 1: High Risk) along with the prediction probability.
